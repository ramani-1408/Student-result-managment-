# Student-result-managment-
# Objective-
You will be creating a full-stack website that uses the student information from a database
as input and generates his/her result in PDF format as output which can then be
downloaded and shared.
# Project Context-
In our day-to-day life, we come across various examination results such as school exam
results, competitive exam results, college semester exam results, etc. How efficiently it
produces someone's result by just filling in student details! But, have you ever thought of
creating one? The ones who did basically went through the hectic job of perfecting their
database and then using the knowledge of front-end and back-end to do so.
Developers are known for doing stuff automatically and efficiently. Thus we can have an
easier take on it, by creating a system that accepts the student details as input and
generates the desired result as output.
# Applications-
• Create and manage school or institute result portals.
• Create other types of management systems.
# Understanding system workflow-
Our project is going to be a full stack application. A full stack application primarily
comprises 3 things - front-end, back-end and database.
So, this project is also divided into 3 parts:
• Result Section (front-end)
• Database
• Admin Section (back-end)
We start by setting things up for the front-end, then for the database and then move
towards the back-end part.
# Expected Outcome -
The main motive of this milestone is to make every cluster club together and test its
functionalities.
